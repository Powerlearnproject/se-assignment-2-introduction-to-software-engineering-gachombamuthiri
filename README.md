# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?It is the designing, developing, testing, deployment and maintenance of high quality systems.It is more systematic and collaborative in software development than traditional programming.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirements;Gathering user needs and system requirements
Design; creating designs of software architecture and user interface
Implementation;writing code according to the design specifications
testing; ensuring software meets the functional requirements.
Deployment;releasing the software to users.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile uses an iterative and incremental approach while waterfall uses a sequential approach with distinct phases.agile is preferred in innovation and experimentation while waterfall is preferred in small scale projects.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
IT is the systematic process of gathering, documenting and maintaining software requirements to ensure users satisfaction.It involves gathering specifications from the users, analyzing and documenting the requiremnts.This ensures the user satisfaction, improves quality, and facilitate communication between the user and the developer.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is breaking down systems into smaller partitions.it simplifies testing making the system easier to understand and maintain.It facilitates easier updates and reducing redundancy.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing;is testing individual components of software.
Integration testing; is testing interactions between subsystems.
system testing; is testing the entire software system.
Acceptance testing; is testing the software against user requirements.
Testing minimizes risks and costs associated with software defects.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
They are tools used to keep track of modifications made to files and allowing developers to collaborate on projects.They are important because they are used as backup,enable branching and collaborations.for example,Git.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
It oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.It is responsible for risk mitigation, resource management.Some challenges are technical complexity and resource constraints.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
It involves the activities done after deployment for system updates and ensure functionality of the software system.It consist of;
corrective maintence:fixing of errors
preventive maintenace:prevent future problems.
Maintenance is essential because allows adaptability,enhances reliability and meets users satisfaction.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Biased algorithms:AI systems can perpetuate societal biases, leading to unfair outcomes
Security vulnerabilities:they must consider the potential harm that could result from security breaches in their software.
To ensure they adhere, they should follow ethical guidelines and codes of conduct and also advocate for ethical practices.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
